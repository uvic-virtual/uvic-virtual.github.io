What is Untangle?
-----------------

Untangle is a 3D geometry based puzzle game in which the player is presented a 
3D shape with its vertexes randomly assigned positions, and it is the players job
to "untangle" the shape so that no faces intersect. 

Additionally, the final product will include a full level editor, so that the player
may create new shapes that will be either automatically or manually tangled.

Stretch goal would be to set up a way to share levels via some type of file format, with both pre- and post- tangle configurations specified.
