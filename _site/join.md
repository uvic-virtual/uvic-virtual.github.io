We are always looking for passionate new members who love learning and want to see what we can do with VR today! In particular, we are looking for:
* Artists who want to learn to make 3D models using VR
* Designers who want to use tools like [Unity](https://unity3d.com/unity) and [Unreal](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/what-is-unreal-engine-4) to realize their vision.
* Software developers who want to learn best practices using industry tools like [GitHub](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) and [Slack](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/115004071768-What-is-Slack-).
* Anyone else who wants to "do" VR!
