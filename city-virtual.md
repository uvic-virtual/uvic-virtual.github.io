# City Virtual - a life simulator

**By Anar Kazimov**

The goal of this project is to create a city in virtual reality that is as similar to the real world as possible.

The concept is very similar to The Sims, however, unlike The Sims, we are aiming to build a platform for business, entertainment and networking, rather than a game. However, the project will start as a game first because the latter is easier to implement.

### Who can this project benefit?

- **Architects/Civil Engineers** - you will have experience in planning and designing the city.
- **SENG/CSC Majors** - well this is self-explanatory, you will have C# coding experience, basic knowledge of WebSockets and understanding of how Git works.
- **Artists** - This project will need 3D Models, Music and Character design. It is hard to imagine any other project that needs just as many artists as City Virtual does.
- **Psychology Majors** - Surprising right? Actually not if you think about it. We need to have the right affordances for the objects, figure out how we will accommodate different demographics and think about how we gonna solve different problems ranging from toxic gaming culture to radicalisation of people through the web.
- **Everybody** - this is the project is so broad that it touches all of the majors so everybody is welcome. We will find something for you.

### Who are our target users?

While developing the project it is necessary to keep in mind who is our audience, because that helps us to assure that we are on the right track. For this project the target audience is as broad as it can be - it is the general public. That means that we should avoid anything that makes the whole project appealing only to a certain demographic.

### How? How? How?

Our assets such as cars and buildings will either be built using **Blender** or will be downloaded from external sources, to transform these 3d models into an interactive city we will use a game engine called **Unity 3D**. If you don't have skills in either of these don't worry, the first couple of meetings I will have tutorials dedicated to teaching the basics of Unity 3D and Blender.

### What is the time commitment?

This is up to you. You choose if you want to be a core member, a temporary member or a casual contributor. Credit will be given accordingly. The harder you work the more benefits you will get.

### Will this project have an impact on the world?

Well, these are some of the things that come to my mind when I think about it. However, there are way more implications than that.

- People feel that they lose their friends when they move to a new place. Let's face it, Skype and Video Call is not the same as Face2Face conversations. City-Virtual will be the closes thing people can have to real life interaction.
- Social Awkwardness - some people will terrified when they have to talk to new people, however in VR they might find this way easier.
- Self-expression - some people might find it easier to express what they feel and think to the public in VR than in reality. That can lead to new forms of theatre, poetry and arts in general.
